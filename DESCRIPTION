Description: Uses Bayesian inference + SWOT river measurements to estimate the normalized gas exchange velocity from rivers, no in situ info needed beyond a prior estimate on streamflow. Algorithm inputs are river width, water surface slope, the change in water surface area, and a prior estiate of average streamflow conditions. The algorithm returns the posterior mean (and 95% CIs) for the normalized river gas exchange velocity for the river reach over time. Note that prior hyperparameters are determined using just the SWOT observations, so all we need to provide BIKER are the SWOT observations and a mean flow estimate.
